# 3D Globe

## Introduction

"3D Globe" is an interactive, scrollable map that provides a beautiful rotation effect, making it a perfect addition to any web3 or modern web project. Built using React and the powerful `@react-three/fiber` library for 3D rendering, along with `@react-three/drei` for convenient React abstractions over three.js objects, this project offers an engaging user experience with its visually appealing globe and floating icons.
